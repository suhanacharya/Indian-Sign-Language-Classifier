# Indian Sign Language Classifier

It's a working experiment with tensorflow and CNNs that classifies Indian Sign Language to different Letters off the English Alphabet.

Currently it takes only static images of handsigns and return a letter.
Still a work in progress. I haven't uploaded the dataset yet.

 Its a dataset that I've made by recording my own hand and splitting the video, it may not classify other people's hands because it is definately biased to my hand.

Testing out and learning how to create and classify datasets using CNN.

### Todo List

[x] Collect/ Create Hand signs Data

[x] Build Static sign Classifier

[ ] Build a Response Image with the letter on the input image

[ ] Create GUI

[ ] Add ability to add more data and transfer Learning
